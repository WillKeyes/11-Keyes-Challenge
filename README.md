## Installation

```
Run an npm install
```

## Usage

It is used by starting up the server and going to your local host. Ideally it should just be a URL that the user goes too, but I was not able to get the site deployed.

## Contributing

They can figure out how to deploy my site

## Tests

```
There is a test script that can be run as the user can see in the package.json.
```
